> Bankless Wallet is a decentralized smart contract wallet that leverages zero-knowledge proofs for authentication

Unlike traditional wallets with a defined owner, Bankless Wallet operates on the principle that ownership is established through possession of a valid zero-knowledge proof (zk-proof). This ensures a high level of privacy and security, as the identity of the wallet owner remains confidential.

## Implementation

## Features

- Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Bankless Wallet utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to authenticate ownership, allowing users to access their funds without revealing any identifiable information.

- Decentralized: There is no central authority or owner for Bankless Wallet. Ownership is solely determined by possession of the zk-proof.

- Privacy: Users can transact with a high level of privacy since the ownership of the wallet is not tied to any personal information.

- Cross-Chain Support: Bankless Wallet is currently supported on Ethereum Sepolia testnet, Avalanche Fuji testnet, and Arbitrum Sepolia. Cross-chain messaging is achieved through the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).

- Smart Contract Security: The wallet's functionality is implemented through a smart contract, ensuring the security and transparency of transactions.

- GHO Integration: Bankless Wallet supports the GHO token for Gas Payments, a stablecoin made by AAVE, for stable and reliable value storage.
